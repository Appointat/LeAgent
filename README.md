# LeAgent: Your Adaptive AI Companion

## Overview

LeAgent is an innovative AI assistant designed to grow and adapt alongside its user, creating a unique and evolving relationship. Inspired by AI assistants in science fiction, such as J.A.R.V.I.S. or Friday from the Iron Man films, LeAgent aims to bridge the gap between static, pre-programmed assistants and truly personalized AI companions.

The name "LeAgent" combines the French article "Le" with "Agent," symbolizing a sophisticated, adaptive assistant that transcends language and cultural barriers.

## Key Features
