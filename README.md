# LeAgent: Your Adaptive AI Companion

### Note: My dear developers and users, this project was established in March 2023. At that time, the concept of RAG had not yet become widespread. However, I've recently come up with new ideas and plan to work on a project involving a learning RAG+agent (the ultimate goal is to realize an AI like Iron Man's Jarvis). Thanks! Please give me a few months to restructure this project. Thank you for your support. As a professional developer and algorithm engineer, I promise not to let you down. The vision is as follows:

## Overview

LeAgent is an innovative AI assistant designed to grow and adapt alongside its user, creating a unique and evolving relationship. Inspired by AI assistants in science fiction, such as J.A.R.V.I.S. or Friday from the Iron Man films, LeAgent aims to bridge the gap between static, pre-programmed assistants and truly personalized AI companions.

The name "LeAgent" combines the French article "Le" with "Agent," symbolizing a sophisticated, adaptive assistant that transcends language and cultural barriers.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Learning**: Learns and adapts in real-time based on user interactions.
- **Personalization**: Tailors responses, suggestions, and behavior to individual user preferences and habits.
- **Natural Interaction**: Utilizes advanced natural language understanding for more human-like conversations.
- **Task Management**: Provides efficient assistance with various tasks, from scheduling to information retrieval.
- **Continuous Growth**: Designed to continuously improve and expand capabilities over time.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Ensures user data is handled securely and ethically.

## Technology Stack

- Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language processing
- Incremental learning algorithms for real-time adaptation
- Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for intent recognition
- Efficient data structures for memory management and quick retrieval
